    <p><a href="./dialogueforest.html">A bit more than a year ago</a>, I shipped DialogueForest, which had itself been in development for a year+...<br>
So the app is actually almost three years old now! Wow!<br>
<img alt="DialogueForest screenshot" src="images/dialogueforest/screenshot.png"><br>
I don't update it that much as it's really mostly for my personal use<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#note-1">*</a></sup>, but as the Windows App SDK runtime keeps getting updates, it was getting a bit difficult to run the executable I shipped on <a href="https://difegue.itch.io/dialogueforest">itch.io</a> back then.  </p>
<p>So I solved that and added a <a href="https://github.com/Difegue/DialogueForest/releases/tag/v.1.0.4">few more features</a>:<br>
DialogueForest is now on the <strong>Microsoft Store</strong> so you can 1-click install it, <em>entirely free</em>.  </p>
<p><a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P7MWMG1V6M6?cid=tvc-16&mode=full">
    <img src="https://get.microsoft.com/images/en-us%20dark.svg" width="200"/>
</a></p>
<p>Merry Christmas! Go write some dialogue for your games.  </p>
<p><img width="400px" alt="i hadnt opened spline in more than a year it's still pretty fun" src="images/dialogueforest/ForestXmas.png" title="i hadnt opened spline in more than a year it's still pretty fun"></p>
<p>... You're still here? I guess I did promise some ranting.  </p>
<p>So one of the reasons I'd held back MS Store publishing for this app back then was...<br>
that I was planning to add <strong>AI</strong> to it! ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»<br>
Not really because I believed in the technology <sub>(especially not for creative writing, miss me with that shit)</sub>, but I wanted to ðŸ§ªexperimentðŸ§ª with something.  </p>
<p>Microsoft was promising those <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/apis/phi-silica">shiny new WinAppSDK APIs</a> in May to interact with language models that'd be bundled with Windows -- With those, it'd cost essentially <em>no effort or money</em> to integrate text/dialogue generation in the app.  </p>
<p>So I would put the app on the store...<br>
Add in the AI integration as a <strong>5$ paid in-app-purchase</strong>...<br>
<strong>Market the app</strong> as being "<em>enhanced by the incredible power of AI!!1!1!</em>"...  <br>
Get <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/welcoming-ai-to-the-microsoft-store-on-windows/">featured on the store</a> by Microsoft who's desperate to sell that shit to everyone who has eyes...  <br>
And <strong>rack in the money</strong> from the room-temperature-IQ Elon Musk fans who think a glorified autocomplete is the future of technology.  </p>
<p>The plan was, dare I say it, perfect; I just needed to wait for the APIs to become available... 
<img alt="yes this meme format is outdated and i'm immediately exposing myself as a poser for misusing it with technical bullshit terms like &quot;API&quot; like I'm trying to write an out of touch marketing blogpost for a big tech company IT'S PART OF THE JOKE I SWEAR" src="images/dialogueforest/gru_df.jpg"><br>
I honestly thought that since this was yet another of Microsoft's famous <em>"refocus the entire OS on a single bit of tech</em>" moments, this stuff would come out relatively early despite the fact Windows UI technology/WinAppSDK moves at a glacial pace...<br>
But nope, <code>Microsoft.Windows.AI.Generative</code> is still unavailable more than 6 months later.  </p>
<p>As a result, what's the current guidance from Microsoft if I want, as a Windows developer, to join the <br>
""""AI Revolution""""? Well, they made a whole app about it with examples, <a href="https://aka.ms/ai-dev-gallery-blog">look how nice it is</a>!<br>
<img alt="huggingface is also a terrible platform btw" src="images/dialogueforest/aidevgallery.png"><br>
...And it basically boils down to "<em>Download some shit from huggingface, slap it into your app and run the model yourself on GPU -- want language processing? That'll be an extra 2 gigabytes thank you</em>"<br>
It's laughable, nobody's realistically going to do this??<sup id="ref-2"><a href="#note-2">**</a></sup>    </p>
<p>Even <strong>Apple</strong>, who did the <em>least</em> possible amount of compliance so that their shareholders wouldn't crash the stock by fear of missing the AI hype train, added <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageplayground">some tools</a> for developers to use their built-in generative stuff.  </p>
<p>It's shit, <em>but at least you can use it</em>!<br>
Microsoft is one of the companies who went the hardest on dooming themselves with AI garbage,<br>
<strong>and EVEN THEN THEY CAN'T FUCKING DO IT RIGHT!</strong>  </p>
<p><br/>
<br/><br>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>... aight i got that out of my system we good now<br>
<img alt="" src="images/dasitmane.jpg"><br>
I imagine most of the preinstalled-AI-on-Windows stuff was severely delayed by the Recall <a href="https://doublepulsar.com/recall-stealing-everything-youve-ever-typed-or-viewed-on-your-own-windows-pc-is-now-possible-da3e12e9465e">trash fire</a>, which is how we got to this silly situation.  </p>
<p>I don't really blame<sup id="ref-3"><a href="#note-3">***</a></sup> the Windows devs, this shit comes down from management and they were absolutely right to redirect their limited resources into <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2024/09/04/whats-new-in-windows-app-sdk-1-6/">actually useful stuff</a> instead of those APIs.  </p>
<p>But well, as for my <em>devilish AI plan</em>? The hype cycle is essentially dead by now. <sub>(if it was ever somewhat alive)</sub><br>
When you look at OpenAI trying to stir hype with their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24314146/openai-12-days-ship-mas-chatgpt-sora-o1-update">"12 days of shipmas"</a> <sub>(terrible techbro ass name btw)</sub> and delivering <strong>nothing of value</strong><sup id="ref-4"><a href="#note-4">#</a></sup>, I don't see it picking back up.  </p>
<p>There's absolutely zero incentive from me to bundle any form of AI to DialogueForest now, so I thought I might as well just <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P7MWMG1V6M6?cid=tvc-16&amp;mode=full">put it up on the Store</a>. And with AOT, it's now faster, so it was worth the wait? <em>Kinda?</em>  </p>

<p><sup id="note-1"><a href="#ref-1">*</a> I actually haven't been using it that much recently... game writing takes time and I don't have it because I'm here ranting about how capitalistic boom/bust cycles are ruining the computer experience for everyone</sup><br>
<sup id="note-2"><a href="#ref-2">**</a> I do think there's a lot of use for small bundled ML models (remember when we just called it ML? good times), but nobody is going to cram a bloody 2GB+ stable diffusion or llama model in a consumer app and call that good user experience, be realistic </sup><br>
<sup id="note-3"><a href="#ref-3">***</a> You know what I <strong>do</strong> blame them for? <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/issues/1808">You still can't make an x86/ARM msixbundle in one click using Visual Studio with WinAppSDK/WinUI3</a>, it's been fuckbusted for ages and there's no indication as to why it fails and you have to make separate per-architecture packages instead. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBelvYeF440">Phenomenal</a> </sup><br>
