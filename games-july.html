    <p>...wow I totally meant to make more than <a href="./games-february.html">one of those</a> in the last 5 months but didn't get to it<br>
I'm writing this mostly because I want to use vscode's new <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_80#_markdown-format-pasted-urls-as-markdown-links">paste-as-markdown feature</a>, which makes writing those blogposts a cinch!  </p>
<p>Speaking of links, I've had the honor of Pixel <a href="https://twitter.com/pigadev/status/1685636317982650369?s=20">linking to DoujinSoft</a> recently to showcase his old 2010 WarioWare DIY game<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#note-1">*</a></sup>. As a cranky old nerd who played Cave Story back in its freeware days, it's great to see those small games keep living through the internet.  </p>
<p>And speaking of small games and cranks..... <sup><sub>damn, double transition? showoff</sup></sub>  </p>
<h1>Panic Playdate</h1>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of Recommendation Dog, for the Panic Playdate" src="images/games/playdate-1.gif">  </p>
<p>Group 4 representing -- I've finally received my <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a> console in the mail recently.<br>
It <strong>is</strong> a lovely device, as expected buttons are nice, you can crank the crank and all that -- But what I've been liking most has to be the <strong>interface</strong>.  </p>
<p>It's all 1-bit dither<sup id="ref-2"><a href="#note-2">**</a></sup> patterns like you're playing <em><a href="https://hypercard.org/">Hypercard</a>: The Console</em>, but at a much smoother frame rate, and what the UI lacks in color, it more than makes up for in animation and style:<br>
üéÅ New games show up in little present boxes like the 3DS/Wii U menus... Except the wrapping paper is customized for each game!<br>
üß∂ The Settings menu has a breadcrumb navigation indicator, which each submenu having its own little icon when it shows up in the navigation.</p>
<p>As for the games, I'm still waiting to get all my season 1 stuff, but I've had a lot of fun with <em><a href="https://play.date/games/casual-birder/">Casual Birder</a></em>.<br>
<em><a href="https://play.date/games/crankin/">Crankin's Adventure</a></em> is a game that could probably only exist on this device due to the fine analog control it requires...But the game itself hasn't grabbed me as much, it gets a bit too grindy and frustrating the further down the levels you go.<br>
<img alt="A screenshot of Reel Steal, a game from the Playdate Catalog you can doodle in" src="images/games/playdate-2.gif"><br>
There are some nice free games in the <a href="https://play.date/games/">Catalog/Store</a><sup id="ref-3"><a href="#note-3">***</a></sup> as well now -- <em><a href="https://play.date/games/recommendation-dog/">Recommendation Dog</a></em> and <em><a href="https://play.date/games/reel-steal/">Reel Steal</a></em> are nice arcadey romps you should try.<br>
In another <em>probably-inspired-by-Nintendo-handhelds</em> moment, the Store has its own <a href="https://play.date/catalog/music">music.</a> It's great<sup id="ref-4"><a href="#note-4">#</a></sup>!  </p>
<h1>Endless Monday: Dreams and Deadlines</h1>
<p>A nice visual novel on Steam you should <a href="https://endlessmonday.com/monthly/">consider buying</a>.<br>
6 hours of reading, peppered with nice sub-games here and there, great pixel art, soundtrack is <a href="https://chancethrash.bandcamp.com/track/cubical-for-two">good vibes</a>. üëç  </p>
<p>I'm more biased than usual on this one considering I've been following the creator <a href="https://twitter.com/hcnone">on Twitter</a> for a while, and you can totally see parallels between their real-life situation and the various plots in the game. <br>
<img alt="look at this delightful pixelart corporate memphis... truly peak susan karecore" src="images/games/monday.jpg"><br>
It's also a very...current-feeling story at times? There's nothing super deep as things mostly remain comedic, but the game digs a bit into the consequences of AI<sup id="ref-5"><a href="#note-5">##</a></sup> for current workforces, and how capital will drain you of resources and eventually come for your head if you let it run unchecked.<br>
<img alt="diablo 4 in a nutshell" src="images/games/monday-2.jpg"><br>
I've talked previously about <a href="./2022-recap.html">"art that is unabashedly sincere"</a>, and I feel that game matches this -- It's very much something that could only be made in 2023 with those gnawing doubts about the future of artists in mind.</p>
<h1>Quake 2</h1>
<p>Full-on downgrade compared to Quake 1 holy hell<br>
Environments are worse, enemy design is boring, weapons are serviceable but that's it, and you can't break it in half by rocket/grenade launching 0/10<br>
<img alt="rtx tim willits is not real he cannot hurt you" src="images/games/q2.jpg"><br>
I played the RTX port by toggling between the OpenGL and RTX renderers to see the differences.<br>
You could argue the RTX version breaks the mood of the game but it's not like it has much to begin with..<br>
Here are <a href="./quake-rtx.html">some RTX off/on comparisons</a> if you're interested.  </p>
<p>My personal favorite has to be the nvidia logo slap-dashed in that one area you can rocketjump over to find a secret:<br>
<img alt="nooo not the overpriced graphics card empire" src="images/games/q2-3-on.jpg"><br>
I like the attempt at making interconnected maps with objectives that require you to move back and forth, but it's not really exploited all that well until the final level, which feels a bit more like an actual dungeon.<br>
Oh and the fucking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBQqDZwSUrA">skewered dopefish</a> easter egg which you can only find by backtracking?? This game has the cringiest easter eggs in all of id software history and I mean it    </p>
<p>The soundtrack is of course a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY6yBTYxLko">banger</a> everyone knows it, but I'm gonna have to go apologize to tim epic because Unreal was better than this mess</p>
<h1>HROT</h1>
<p>Oh lookie here, it's the better Quake 2!<br>
<img alt="hit me with that slavsthetic NOW" src="images/games/hrot.jpg"><br>
Despite having an even blander palette (<em>it's all brown</em>), this game manages to have quite the variety of environments, accompanied by rock-solid level design.<br>
There's quite the variety of enemies and bosses too! And the super shotgun is A+, as shrimple as that.</p>
<p>Despite the advertised theme being "post-USSR horror freakshow gone wrong", the game actually gets <em>goofier</em><sup id="ref-6"><a href="#note-6">###</a></sup> as the levels move on and you don't really get any kind of resolution out of the scraps of worldbuilding you're given...<br>
It's still a good time though!    </p>
<h1>Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer</h1>
<p>Capping off with another FPS, spinoff of the excellent <em>Hypnospace Outlaw</em>.<br>
<img alt="this image weighs...420 kilobytes. woah......." src="images/games/slayers-2.jpg"><br>
Now, it doesn't have as much fake operating system-ness as <em>Outlaw</em>, but it delivers in spades in being a magnificent shitpost homage to early 2000's culture.  </p>
<p>The game...looks bad, but only when it <em>wants to</em> -- There's real design and care here, and it walks that tightrope all the way to the end.<br>
There's something to be said about kamehameha-ing (literal)shit monsters with your sick <code>hacker powers</code>, watching a cutscene with uncanny valley 3D rendering, then right afterwards finding a secret where the (fictional) single dad level designer put drawings by his three-year old in the map.     <br>
<img alt="there's still &quot;some&quot; fake computer stuff tho look how sick this is" src="images/games/slayers-1.jpg"><br>
I really recommend this one, it's even on Game Pass right now if that's your thing.  </p>
<p>Soundtrack is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGo-MLA6YfU">triple A fucking incredible</a>, <s>Jay Tholen</s> <em><strong>BIG Z. CORP</strong></em> has done it again!<br>
It's also a <strong>dynamic</strong> soundtrack with combat/stress/relaxed layers for some reason? I approve, even though the in-game mixing is sometimes a bit jank-<span style="font-family:comic sans ms; font-size: 25px"/><strong>THE S-BLADE HAS A HACKBLOOD CHARGE</strong></span>  </p>
