    <p><img alt="old logo and favicon" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/lrr-nuicon/old.png">  </p>
<p>The favicon you've probably already seen a thousand times if you have a <a href="https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi">LANraragi</a> install was ripped off from a Japanese Monogatari website sometime in late 2014. (get it b/c it's araragi and you see the ahoge and everything haha)<br>
The logo came a bit later(late 2016), but it's essentially just an edit of the ubiquitous <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons/cubes?style=solid">fa-cubes</a>.  </p>
<p>The favicon served me well enough, but it's starting to feel really low-res, and doesn't really work well on dark backgrounds.<br>
As for the logo, it doesn't look very nice at low resolutions either if I were to make it the new favicon.  </p>
<p>Therefore, I've been wanting to update the LRR logo in order to make it:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Legible/Recognizable enough at low resolution</li>
<li>Work on both light and dark backgrounds</li>
<li>Not a ripoff of existing art (don't want to risk a lawsuit from aniplex and fontawesome if i ever make it big i swear on me mum they'd do it we live in a society)</li>
</ul>
<p>while not losing what makes it <strong>unique</strong>, by which I mean keeping the ahoge motif.  </p>
<p><img width="300" alt="can you believe this image is 9 years old already oh my god where does the time go" src="/images/lrr-nuicon/rrg.jpg"/>  </p>
<h2>Thoughts and process</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.justinmind.com/blog/neumorphism-ui/">Neumorphism</a> is the new design meme, but outside of outlandish dribble mockups it seems to just translate to softer shadows and more transparency, with a little bit of 3D thrown in.<br>
<sup><sub>Not a design expert please don't scream at me for not getting it</sup></sub></p>
<p>So, let's make a 3D icon! Using the one and only free 3D tool all grand designers use, <s>Blender</s> Paint 3D by Microsoft:  </p>
<p><img alt="it aint stupid if it works" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/lrr-nuicon/p3D.jpg">  </p>
<p>I took the existing 3D logo I'd already made for the <a href="./hacktoberfest-lrr-2.html">5 years hacktoberfest</a>, and started iterating from there.</p>
<p>To help with recognizing the icon at low-res, the best thing to do was to bring in some <strong>color</strong> to the blocks.<br>
The color scheme was inspired by the WinRAR icon, since LRR deals with archive/compressed files basically all the time!  </p>
<p><img alt="the finger tool in gimp has been my best ally for over 8 years now and it aint stopping anytime soon" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/lrr-nuicon/study.jpg"></p>
<p>Fully coloring them looked kinda garbo, so I went <strong>arthouse</strong> and just scribbled some lines.<br>
Paint 3D did a surprisingly good job at handling the breadth of the lines depending on the depth, and it reminds me of the NeXTSTEP blocks so I like it:  </p>
<p><img alt="damn its like i'm steve jobs" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/lrr-nuicon/OIP.jpg">  </p>
<p>I was kinda scared of the 3D ahoge looking like a piece of poop straight outta <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk2hzFC5Zok">Duke Nukem Forever</a> with the glossy lighting and low polycount, but thankfully it looks quite good after some post-processing in <s>Photoshop</s> GIMP to smooth it out.  </p>
<p><img alt="new favicon" src="/images/lrr-nuicon/new.png" width="550"/> <img alt="hmu in the comments if you actually read those alt texts" src="/images/lrr-nuicon/splash.jpg" width="250"/>  </p>
<p>I really dig the way it's positioned though! It pops out <strong>way</strong> more than in the previous icon, and having it rotated to the side brings a lot of extra depth.<br>
Having it burrowed a bit more into the blocks also makes it recognizable even at low resolutions. <sup><sub>and it kinda looks like a parasitic slug so that's cool </sup></sub>  </p>
<p>The design doesn't fare as well as I'd hoped on dark backgrounds however, so I slapped a squircle straight out of the Apple playbook for the icon variant.<br>
It looks a bit weird on Windows since squircles aren't really a thing in MS iconography, but the Windows app is just a launcher anyways so eh Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯  </p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p><em>m8 this icon thing is easy who needs designers rite just slap some 3D blocks and ur good</em>  </p>
<p>I wanted to name 0.7.7 Video Crime at first since it's basically the only Tin Machine song I like, but since I pick the Bowie song names proportional to the quality of the release, and 0.7.7 was <strong>super</strong> huge, I went for Pallas Athena instead.<br>
Probably my favorite song from <em>Black Tie White Noise</em>, although I love most of the album it's real darn good  </p>
<p>I took the opportunity to remake my OpenGraph Github splash as well, using Inter as the typography:<br>
<img alt="now in the iOS app store! what have I become good lord forgive me for I have sinned" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/lrr-nuicon/opengraph.jpg"><br>
I'll kinda miss the low-res GIMP pepper from the previous version.  </p>
