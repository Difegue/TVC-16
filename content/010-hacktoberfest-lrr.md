## Hacktoberfest  

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is well underway!  
I personally got my four PRs in and I suggest looking at [this handy list](https://hacktoberfestswaglist.com/) to maximize the amount of free shitâ„¢ you can get from companies desperate for contributions.  

It's also about time I made my yearly sticker order for Christmas, so I thought I'd use the opportunity to provide a bonus incentive.

I'll ship out this `very cool` sticker set to anyone who makes a (not-crap) PR to [the LRR repo.](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi)  
(Hacktoberfest PRs from the start of the month count too so hit me up)  

I have some issues available under the [Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest) tag for would-be volunteers.  
There are quite a few of them that [don't require](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/issues/196) [writing a single line](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/issues/195) [of server code](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/issues/189), so I better not hear the excuse that Perl is a hindrance this time 'round.  

## GitHub Sponsors  

If you're not good at programming but really **really** want this dumb sticker pack (god bless your twisted soul), I'm also sending one to anyone who pledges $5+ on my newly-minted GitHub Sponsors page [here.](https://github.com/users/Difegue/sponsorship)

GitHub matches whatever you put as your pledge, so there's never been a better time to help me get filthy rich through open source.

(If you don't want to steal Microsoft's money, [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/lanraragi) is still available too.)

## Claiming your stickers  

If you did one of the above, you can go to the [following form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAN__osxt25URTdTUTVBVFRCTjlYWFJLMlEzRTJPUEhEVy4u) to give me a mail address to ship the stuff to.  
Happy Hacking!
