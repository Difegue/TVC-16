Summary: Thank you, Ryuichi Sakamoto.

It's been... [a year](./stylophone-25.html) once again! Wow!   
Now that the [gamedev](./funtography) side of the hustle has quieted down a bit, it's time to get back into the app business.  

In this hectic period of iOS17 app updates, I'm happy to deliver... the **_iOS16_ update** for Stylophone<sup id="ref-1">[*](#note-1)</sup>. ðŸ¤²  
`v2.6` is a fairly large update, fixing some longstanding bugs for both iOS and Windows/Xbox.  

The iOS version has freed itself from the shackles of _old_ Xamarin and is now... on [_new_ Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/wiki/.NET-release-notes-Xcode-13.3), AKA .NET 7.  

The Windows version hasn't budged at all since I still want to support Xboxes<sup id="ref-2">[**](#note-2)</sup>.  
It still got some nice new UI improvements thanks to the recent [Windows Community Toolkit](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/ifdef-windows/announcing-windows-community-toolkit-v8-0/) update, however!

_iOS/iPadOS_ received the blunt of the UI work this time - iPhone users should enjoy much more usable table views now, with edit mode enabled for **quick reorder/deletion**.  
I added a bunch of missing Narrator/VoiceOver hints following reports by a visually impaired user to both versions. Kinda wish I'd gone over that earlier considering how easy it was..

There's some new MPD feature support as well, most notably the new `playlistdelete` range functionality!  
I have made a matching [MpcNET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MpcNET/) nuget release, in case you want to use that.  

### As usual, the apps can be downloaded from both the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NCB693428T8?cid=storebadge&ocid=badge) and the [App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stylophone/id1644672889?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200)  

I hope you enjoy the updates! Free for existing users as always. Here's the full changelog:

# Closing thoughts  
![good ol' vsmac..]({static}/images/stylophone/vsmac.png)  
Working on the iOS version of Stylophone means I get to pull out **Visual Studio for Mac**... Which is [dying soon.](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-for-mac-retirement-announcement/)  
I'm gonna miss the thing!  

Sure, it's the red-headed stepchild of regular Visual Studio, built off the back of [MonoDevelop](https://github.com/mono/monodevelop/) without contributing sources back... But I got into macOS/iOS development with it and for all its weird faults and bugs, it was _fine_ and had a decent workflow for Xamarin-based projects.  

It feels especially wasteful considering they [revamped large swaths](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-for-mac-is-now-available/) of it **last year**!  
ðŸ¤¨ What the fuck is Microsoft even _doing_? Did they just fire most of the devs in their godawful layoffs and couldn't keep it going?  

![Please do not dunk on my music tastes too hard]({static}/images/stylophone/v25-catalyst.jpg)  

On the flipside, having moved to NET7 gives me access to Mac Catalyst builds of Stylophone again...  
There are [great native](https://github.com/danbee/persephone) MPD clients for macOS already, but I might release that as a freebie version later.  
  
Maybe even with iOS16 goodies thrown in!

<sup id="note-1">[\*](#ref-1) I really wanted to use [TipKit](https://bendodson.com/weblog/2023/07/26/tipkit-tutorial/), but the xamarin bindings probably won't be ready for another few months... Them be the woes of cross-platform development.</sup>  
<sup id="note-2">[\*\*](#ref-2) which hopefully will be more usable now that I'm using the ol' silent .wav technique to prevent the app from being background killed ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž</sup>  
<sup id="note-3">[\*\*\*](#ref-3) Also my mac mini doesn't support Ventura and I already had to hack the minversion to get Xcode 14.3 to run sooo </sup>
