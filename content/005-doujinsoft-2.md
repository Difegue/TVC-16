Summary: We have to go back... to WiiConnect24!

Remember [WarioWare D.I.Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare_D.I.Y.)? The Nintendo DS game for making WarioWare-style microgames.  
It's turning 10 this year and stands as, in my opinion, the best in Nintendo's "_wacky user-generated content with that weird [baby face good lord what is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_Yd2gn37AM)_" series.  (Alongside other grands like Mario Paint and both Mario Maker games)  

I launched [the DoujinSoft Store/Archiver](https://diy.tvc-16.science/) two years ago as a way to easily catalogue all the content created with the game. It's a pretty obvious rip-off of the [Mario Maker Bookmark Site](https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net), to stay in-theme.  

As-is, it's a good archive of all the stuff people made back in the day, but there wasn't an easy way to play the games, save from injecting them yourself into a savefile for the DS Game. Ditto for sharing newly made games with other people.

DIY had a matching game on the Wii, WarioWare DIY Showcase, which acted as extra storage for your DS Games, alongside a few other things. Namely, the possibility to _send/receive games_ from Wii friends.  

I was approached recently by the good folks at [RiiConnect24](https://rc24.xyz/), who'd figured out how this part worked.  
Cue a bit of jolly co-operation, and I'm happy to present **DoujinSoft 2.0**, now featuring:  

* A complete dump of the content that was available on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection before its closure:  
That's around <h1>_185 233â€¬_</h1> Games/Music/Comics you can peruse! They're all pretty small so thankfully it compresses well ðŸ‘€ðŸ’¦  
* **RiiConnect24** integration, allowing you to choose games on the storefront and get them **directly** shipped to your Wii system.  

![look at that swanky modal](images/djsoft2.jpg)

You'll also get nice custom letters on your Wii Message Board if you use the feature!  
(Well technically they're the old ones from the Wii Shop Channel <sup>but personally I was only gifted a game once so it's not like I saw them that often</sup>)

## What's next for DoujinSoft 3.0 

I'm doing the giving, so I might as well start doing the receiving!  
DIY Showcase allows players to rate the games they receive, so there's a fun integration to be made here.

Past that, it only makes sense that users would be able to send/upload their own games to DoujinSoft using their Wii consoles. It'd almost make us look like a proper online service!  

## The technical breakdown

Since this is a tech blog, if you're interested in how WiiConnect24 ticks I've written [a fair bit about what I learned here.](./doujinsoft-rc24.html) Thanks for reading, and have fun using DoujinSoft!
