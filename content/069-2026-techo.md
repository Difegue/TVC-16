Summary: Stationery suggestions and Cover considerations.

It's [Hobonichi Techo preview season](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/2026/y26/) again!  
Here's a list of designs from this year's lineup I find neat‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.  

While last year was a pretty good time Yen-wise to buy a planner, this year feels noticeably worse, **especially** if you're in the US... I guess you can try using their [new phone app](https://techoapp.1101.com/en/) instead?  
![](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/images/tx/topen/1755513296640_mag_y26_techoapp_sq_en.jpg)  
I don't know how I feel about that one, it looks a bit more fun than existing offerings like Apple's Journaling app, but the reason I personally buy those planners is to, yknow, **avoid using a computer**.  

You can't really paste or draw random crap with a phone app and it's one of the reasons I've never really been able to keep up with digital note-taking<sup id="ref-1">[*](#note-1)</sup>... I'll still give it a spin just out of curiosity and because [Shogo Sakai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3xDw-gBoXM) is doing the BGM.  

The assistants look cute, but it's unclear if they're actually AI/LLM shit or not? If it's just some basic image recognition that'd be fine.  

#  
I usually make those Techoposts at the end of the year when I [switch my planner](./2025-techo.html), but most of the time what I bought is long sold out by this point...  
So I thought this year I'd actually make the post _right before sales actually begin_ - It also serves as my shopping list as a result instead of having to keep 20 tabs on my desktop! I'm a genius.

# Techo Covers  

### [Yuichi Inoue - Hana (Flower)](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc26_inoue/)
![Yuichi Inoue - Hana (Flower)](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/oc26_inoue/prod_02.webp)  
This one is pretty nice and I really dig the yellow accent as you might have realized by how this blog looks.  
It's similar to 2020's [Ochitsuke cover](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2020/pc/detail_cover/oc20_ochitsuke/), but with a bit more flair. The lavender bookmarks are nice too!  

### [MOTHER - Mr. Saturn (It‚Äôs Great)](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc26_mothersaturn/)
![Mr. Saturn lenticular cover](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/oc26_mothersaturn/prod_02.webp)  
There have been a lot of Mr.Saturn themed covers over the years and I somehow haven't bought one yet... But this one is really tempting with the lenticular effect. Forget great, it's **cool**!  
It is a bit more expensive than the other covers though; Not to the outrageous level of the [leather one from last year](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc25_mothernbike/), but still a solid 10‚Ç¨ extra from the flower one, for example.   

Also note the [larger A5 variant](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/cc26_mothersaturn/) with even more lenticular Mr.Saturns!  
I always buy yearly originals, since I don't really write enough (or draw) to fill those huge A5 planners.  

### [Junji Ito - Tomie - Knowing Smile](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc26_jito/)  
![](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/oc26_jito/prod_02.webp)  
What's up with the material choices this year? I'm not complaining though.  
The iridescent/shiny material peeking through works really well with Junji's older artwork on this one, it's giving old mecha anime freezeframe vibes. <sub>Does that make sense? I wish I had an example screenshot on hand but I don't</sub>  

### [Naoki Ishikawa - Denali in the Midnight Sun #1](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc25_ishikawa/)
![Denali in the Midnight Sun cyanotype cover](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/oc25_ishikawa/prod_02.webp)  
This one is technically from last year, but it's still available and was in my bucket list back then.  
I just think cyanotype is really neat! It's also cheaper than the other covers due to being an older design.  

The inside of the cover is a bit boring, but that doesn't really matter when you're actually using it.  

### [Tamagotchi - Cover on Cover for A6 Size (Growth Chart!)](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_coco_tamagotchi/)
![Tamagotchi - Cover on Cover](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/tt_coco_tamagotchi/prod_01.webp)  
The Tamagotchi collab for this year is pretty cool, but I'm not a fan of the [cover design](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc26_tamagotchi/) they put out for it -- It's far too busy and heavy on the pixel art overall... This translucent cover-on-cover though? Pretty good!  

Those are nice alternatives to buying "full" covers, since you can pair them with one of the (comparatively cheap) [unicolor covers](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc25_colorswcandle/) and mix-and-match however you want.  
If you're more money-savvy than I am and don't buy a brand new cover every year, cover-on-covers are nice alternatives to still switch up the design of your Techo every year.  

I might do something stupid this year and pair this with the Denali cover... It'd be fun, OK? _Do you hate fun or something?_  

# Stationery

### [Hobonichi Stencil - Moomin](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_template_moomin/)  
![Moomin stencil](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/tt_template_moomin/prod_02.webp)  
hell yeah I love me some Moomin  

Similarly to Tamagotchi, I'm not a fan of the [cover design](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc26_moomin/) for this collab, but I'm probably going to grab this stencil so I can mindlessly doodle some Finn creatures in my pages from time to time.  

### [Add-on Sticky Notes](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_addonfusen_tsuki/)
![Add-on Sticky Notes](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/tt_addonfusen_tsuki/loc_02.webp)  
This is one of those "holy shit _technology_" type of stationery, similar to the [Pocket Cards](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_pocket/) which I'm a huge fan of.  
Usually when I write too much I just overflow a bit on the pages of the prior/next day, but being able to just paste an additional sheet like that...what power!  

Of course you could do this by just...pasting a bit of paper from wherever into your page and folding it, but it's nice to have a version that uses the exact same paper and grid size.  

### [TSUKI no IRO - Mini Card Set](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_cardset_tsuki/)  
![Mini Card Set w/ envelopes](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/tt_cardset_tsuki/loc_01.webp)  
Those are just some small cards and matching stickers, more for putting on top of presents than in a planner - I quite like the 70s-ness of the designs though, which is why it's here.

Like everything in the Tsuki no Iro series though, they're a bit expensive...  
Not as bad as "_[64‚Ç¨ for 12 ballpoint pens](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_uballset_tsuki/) what do you MEAN_", but still.  

### [Deco Rush - Tamagotchi](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_decorush_2026/)
![holy shit tama roll](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/tt_decorush_2026/prod_03.webp)  
Do I even have to say anything?  
...Well, I will say that [Deco Rush](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_decorush/) stickers are surprisingly more annoying to apply than you might think looking at the promo pictures -- You have to press down pretty hard or else they'll usually tear upon application.  

### [Stappo - Moomin](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_stappo_moomin/)
![](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/tt_stappo_moomin/prod_01.webp)  
I have now been shilling the Stappo stationery pouch for three years and will continue to do so as long as they release new banger designs for them.  
I almost wish I'd waited before getting mine now that they're putting out those nice versions with necktie fabric and embroidery... alas.  
![Stappo stationery pouch and pretzel-powered bag of holding](images/techo/stappo.jpg)  

### [Just some washi tape](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/s_maste/)
![](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/s_maste/prod_01.webp)  
Is this a boring one to end with? I dig the fruit/food sticker designs and they're about the price of a TF2 key each so...  

Also consider the [Tamagotchi sticky notes](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_fusen_tamagotchi/).
