Summary: I ain't afraid of no CRT.  

My vintage mac fleet has been progressing nicely with all the previous restorations, but I was still missing an essential piece:  
A keyboard and mouse.  

Those machines came to me keyboardless, and I initially thought it'd be no problem at all!  
Alas, I did not know about the terrifying Apple Desktop Bus.

ADB for short (which completely fucks up google searches now that the Android Debug Bridge is a thing),  
this connector was used to plug keyboards, mice, joysticks and what have you into Macintoshes until USB took over.  

Well, I guess I won't be able to use my old PS/2 stuff, might as well invest into some ADB devic--

Yup, screw that.  

# A quick tour of ADB replacement solutions

There surprisingly aren't many solutions to convert other devices to ADB on the market.  
The best one seems to be the [USB-ADB Wombat](https://www.bigmessowires.com/usb-wombat), but that's even more expensive than buying an ol' AppleDesign keyboard.  
You also have http://www.geethree.com/adb/ this thing, which seems rather old and only works for mice. Meh.  

Turning to DIY solutions, most of the stuff out there is meant to use ADB keyboards on modern machines, using code from TMK. https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/tree/master/converter/adb_usb 
Which is nice and all, but the opposite of what I need.  

After a bit more searching I did end up finding a spare forum post: http://thinkclassic.org/viewtopic.php?id=630  
PS/2 to ADB, both keyboard and mouse running off an off-the-shelf Arduino? Sounds great!  

The code is available here: http://synack.net/svn/adbduino/ , so I grabbed an Arduino off the dead project pile and got to work.

# Making the adbduino adapter

The provided .osm file for the circuit board needs Osmond to be opened. https://www.osmondpcb.com/  
Opening it, it's all pretty simple however, no need for extra resistors or anything:

Since I wasn't sure this stuff would actually still work, I breadboarded an abomination.

# Usage and problems encountered




# Spare thoughts

Building this thing cost me around 5$ off AliExpress to get an ADB cable (well, S-video since they use the same plug), and some PS/2 connectors.  
The ADB connector itself was salvaged from an old destroyed PowerBook dock.  

All around, this is much cheaper than buying a real ADB keyboard or a USB adapter, although it certainly isn't flawless.  
The issues I had seem more related to my PS/2 hardware being old than the adapter itself, however.  

You can find my hacked-up version of the adbduino sketch here.
