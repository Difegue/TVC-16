Summary: Who are you running from?

As mentioned in that [previous post](./total-internet-hyperdeath.html), the SAGE Double Donk is **real**!  

I'm anxiously excited to release _Funtography: A Gameboy Cameradventure_, an actual \*gulp* _original_ video game.  
![The SAGE trailer is a pretty cool wallpaper ngl - but you can change it if you want!](./images/funtography/ft2.png)  

### Check it out at [SAGE 2023](https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/funtography-a-gameboy-cameradventure.1861/)! ... Or itch.io if that's more your speed.

In this 2h-long <sub>_(1h if ur quick...)_</sub> adventure game, enjoy looking at **100+ Gameboy Camera pictures** as you explore various urban vistas to solve the mystery of a _missing video game prototype_.

- Four endings!  
- Built-in **developer commentary**!  
- Unlockable soundtrack!  
- **Bonus fake operating system!**  
### It's got it all!  
![i touch on this in the commentary but it's crazy how fast everyone forgot about this olive oil coffee fiasco. hi /agdg/!](./images/funtography/ft_final3.png)  
I hope you will consider taking a look at it in the midst of all the good-ass games releasing at SAGE.  
# Backstory 

The concept behind this game, `Visual novel that uses Gameboy Camera photos with varying palette and borders for extra context` isn't really new<sup id="ref-1">[*](#note-1)</sup> - I tried building this thing close to [10 years ago](https://github.com/Difegue/shaftboy) already.  
!["Catastrophic project which will likely never get finished", dated 2014 -- past me been real quiet since this dropped](./images/funtography/ft_old.png)  
I had a nice homegrown C++ engine with a barebones scripting system and all, ready to support the story... Then the _major blocker_ happened:  

**"what kind of story should I even write, what the shit?"**  

![old shaftboy engine prototype screenshot - you can see that TV photo in the final game nowadays at last..](./images/funtography/ft_proto.png)  

> Humans are natural story-tellers. Our brains are wired for storytelling, both in our enjoyment of experiencing stories, and our ability to create them. This fools us into thinking that storytelling is easy, which itâ€™s not.   
<sub>[(Four Failures: 1996-2002)](https://dreamertalin.medium.com/four-failures-1996-2002-5611b955f14)</sub>  

So I shelved the whole thing, with a bunch of art assets, Gameboy photos and """music""" ready to go.  
![this screen is from january 2022 god where does the time go](images/gamedev/jan_22_screen.jpg)  
As I was building out this fake operating system that could run self-contained small apps and games, the idea of reviving _Funtography_ kinda came up on its own.  

**"If a goal for this fake OS game is to have unlockable smaller games within it... Why shouldn't I just reuse all those old assets I already had?"**  

Then of course it ballooned out of control as I started writing -- The extra engine work and plot outline were made during the lockdowns after bingewatching _Twin Peaks_<sup id="ref-2">[**](#note-2)</sup>, but most of the writing happened this year after work on [DialogueForest](./dialogueforest.html)<sup id="ref-3">[***](#note-3)</sup>  wrapped up.  

Considering the result actually stands out on its own length-wise, I wanted to ship it early, as both a **demo** of the existing fake OS<sup id="ref-4">[#](#note-4)</sup>...and hopefully something compelling enough on its own.  
![](./images/funtography/ft_final4.png)  
Since I'm not really a pro writer, I thought the best I could do would be to make it as earnest/genuine as I could -- Even if it ends up being a bit corny, I hope it at least makes for something more engaging than a ebin ironic story would be.  

At least, I can pretty confidently say it's unique...Which is something I did [mention wanting to do](./2022-recap.html).  
And it does feel nice to have realized an old concept from years past! _I am cringe but I am free._

<sup id="note-1">[\*](#ref-1) Or original for that matter -- Check out [Pocket Puppet](https://pierrec.itch.io/pocket-puppet) if you want more Cameradventure! It even works on real hardware.</sup>  
<sup id="note-2">[\*\*](#ref-2) You can certainly see the influences in the final product - Not as much as I was expecting tho</sup>  
<sup id="note-3">[\*\*\*](#ref-3) Which of course, I did **not** use while writing Funtography... I relied on [VIDE Dialogues](https://videdialogues.wordpress.com) for Unity instead as that allowed me to integrate the SFX/palette/border changes better. Still ended up a mess</sup>  
<sup id="note-4">[#](#ref-4) Slated for release 2035.. I want to keep working on the larger game but I feel some respite knowing that even if I give up on it now, at least some portion of it will have been used. </sup>
