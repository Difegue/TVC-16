Summary: A quick lookback at the progress made since the last survey, and a new one!  

It's been less than a year since [the last user survey results](https://tvc-16.science/lrr-survey.html) for LANraragi -- I went and reread them and it's actually pretty cool to see everything that has been released since.

Here's a quick rundown of everything that landed between this last post and today's [0.7.0 release](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/releases/tag/v.0.7.0):  

* **Categories**/Archive Sets, so you can finally bundle multiple archives in a named thingamabob, to track series, favorites, etc.  
* The Docker image is now available on [a ton](https://hub.docker.com/r/difegue/lanraragi/tags) of architectures, including of course ARM. It's smaller too!  
* Reading progress and total page count is now shown on the main page.  
* **External reader** support has [grown consequently](https://sugoi.gitbook.io/lanraragi/advanced-usage/external-readers), with dedicated Windows/Android clients, a Tachiyomi extension and support for OPDS readers.  
* Full support for **PDF files**.  
* Support for webp and more image files, alongside the ability to dynamically resize images output by the server to save on bandwidth.  
* A [true Windows Installer](https://sugoi.gitbook.io/lanraragi/installing-lanraragi/windows) instead of the ol' PowerShell script.  
* A [Homebrew version](https://sugoi.gitbook.io/lanraragi/installing-lanraragi/macos) now exists to install the server on macOS and Linux with a simple command.
* High-resolution Thumbnails.  
* **Server-Side** searching, using the same modifiers as E\*H.  
* **Tag suggestions** when searching.  
* A much beefier Client API (although work on that side never quite ends..)  
* Preview support for directly **downloading** E\*H links to LRR.  

And probably even more stuff I've forgotten about. ðŸŽŠ  
I think 0.7.0 is a _bretty_ good release and hopefully, you'll think the same.  

The next big ordeal is Downloader support since I finally got tired of downloading my zips manually and dropping them into the Web Uploader, but after that, I might be running out of ideas.  

There's always work to be done, but now is a good time to refresh the User Survey!  
I think the first one yielded some good results, so I'm opening it up once again in order to receive all your hatemail.
