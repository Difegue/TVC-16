Is 2023 the year of the LCD game revival? If [Lucas Pope](https://dukope.com/devlogs/papers-please/lcdplease/) is any indication, it might just be.  
Last year's [Sonic McOrigins](./mcorigins.html) release was quite loved and people keep [covering it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Ox9-IVB6I), but it was incomplete in a few ways.  

Most notably, it was missing a few games and manuals...  
The internet's hunger<sup id="ref-1">[*](#note-1)</sup> for _Shadow Basketball_ could not be contained any longer.  
![Hero image for "Sonic McOrigins Plus", the v2 release of my LCD game simulator. The photo shows a Sonic-themed Happy Meal Box lying on its side with a lot of LCD games pouring out from it, including an Android phone running the simulator. The tagline at the bottom is styled like 2000s Happy Meal adverts and says "to be this good takes ages", alongside some era-appropriate OS logos for Win/Mac/Linux/Android. The sticker on the top left of the photo is the Sonic Boom "Inspired by the video games!" meme, which I totally didn't put there to hide my dodgy photoshop skills hahaha....](images/lcdonald/mcorigins_plus_hero.jpg)

# What's next?

On the short term? 
### _Nothing_! I'm gonna go play some vidya james at [SAGE](https://sagexpo.org/) and so should you.  
If you'd be interested in something not-Sonic related from me, maybe you'd fancy looking at [Funtography](./funtography.html), my _GB Cameradventure game_? It's also at SAGE!  

Regarding the McOrigins project itself...  

* I'm **not** doing any other Sonic LCD games - Leave that to the [pros!](https://archive.org/details/hh_tsonic)  

* An iOS port is **unlikely** since Avalonia doesn't support iOS  

* I'm **not** doing any other McDonald's LCD games since only Sonic could've motivated me to put 2 years of work into this  
    - The [code](https://github.com/Difegue/LCDonald) is all there and free for the taking though, so if you want to simulate the Crash or Spyro games for example, it'd be possible to reuse all of it with your own photos/scans/logic.  
    - I've documented the process [rather](./lcdonald.html) [extensively](./mcorigins.html) at this point and wouldn't mind answering any questions. ‚úåÔ∏è

* One area I _might_ explore would be the [ESPN reskins](https://www.ebay.com/itm/313956178072) of the 2004 series. <sub>It's funnier to me than it has any right to be tbh</sub>  
    - There should be no logic to rewrite, it's just some more photo/scan work.  

* And of course, work finding the missing [instruction manual scans](https://github.com/Difegue/LCDonald/issues) continues.  

All the hubbub around Apple's [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/visionos/) kinda makes me want to look at making a VR/3D version?  
I've talked about [emuVR](https://www.emuvr.net/) before as an example, it'd be funny to have the games available as VRChat props or some stuff like that.  


...But I don't have any form of VR rig atm so it's probably not happening. ü§∑

<sup id="note-1">[\*](#ref-1) "One thesis of the [Read Max newsletter](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-for-12-year-olds?utm_source=TVC-16) is that a huge portion-- much more than you might imagine--of content produced on the internet [...] is consumed by 12-year-olds."</sup>  
<sup id="note-2">[\*\*](#ref-2) I was originally considering _Sonic McOrigins Ultimate_, _Sonic McOrigins DX_, or _Sonic McOrigins & Knuckles_, but Sega went ahead and gave the disappointing DLC treatment to Origins so I didn't really have a choice</sup>  
<sup id="note-3">[\*\*\*](#ref-3) I considered using the [Speedee typeface](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/turner-duckworth-redesign-mcdonalds-branding-visual-identity-graphic-design-250719) for the UI but ultimately decided against it -- It's not like that font was in use back when the games released anyway.</sup>
