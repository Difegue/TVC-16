    <p><a href="https://sagexpo.org/index.html">SAGE 2023</a> has ended, and I did good on my previous <a href="./mcorigins-plus">promise</a> by playing a <strong>heckuva lot</strong> of games.  </p>
<p>Here are some notable ones I've played, in case you might be interested!  </p>
<h2><a href="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/gatoslip-chapter-0.1703/">Gatoslip</a></h2>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/games/sage/gato.jpg"><br>
I liked this a lot, topdown RPGs on megadrive always make me think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_of_Centy">Soleil/Centy</a>, although the Deltarune inspirations are much more obvious -- Having sonicy platformer sequences instead of shmup is really fun.  </p>
<h2><a href="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/b-u-d-d-sage-23-demo.1740/">B.U.D.D</a></h2>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/games/sage/budd.png"><br>
This game truly wears its influences on its sleeve and reminds me I should finish that playthrough of Popful Mail<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#note-1">*</a></sup> I started all those years ago.</p>
<p>Combat system is fun without being too overbearing as things stand, I think it'll be in a pretty good spot once the few missing moves are in the full game.<br>
The SA2-inspired combo meter made me smile but I usually don't get more than a 5 or 6x combo outside of the training room ü•≤</p>
<p>Really great pixel art too! Look at this <em>blessed fake email client.</em> üôè The image loading effect is simple but effective.</p>
<h2><a href="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/susan-taxpayer-orientation-build.1887/">Susan Taxpayer</a></h2>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/games/sage/susan.jpg"><br>
I <strong>really</strong> dig the theming of this, 90's americana office settings are becoming a lost artform and I love how the soundtrack/SFX plays along. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVLAPYx0dc8">tada.wav</a> playing when you get every golden paperclip is chefs kiss tier shit)</p>
<p>The <a href="./games-february">Pizza Tower</a> comparisons are inevitable considering the artstyle and the WL4 inspiration, but this game is much closer to Wario Land speedwise.  </p>
<p>Input windows are a bit tight for some moves right now and the demo doesn't show all the planned powerups, so I'm interested to see what comes next.  </p>
<h2><a href="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/sondro-gomez-sage-23.1676/">Sondro Gomez</a></h2>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/games/sage/gomez.png"><br>
Art direction is A+, both with the ingame sprites and the cutscenes/outside art.<br>
This has 3 playable characters, each going through variants of the same levels with (heavily) tweaked music<sup id="ref-2"><a href="#note-2">**</a></sup>/level design.  </p>
<p>Despite looking like Castlevania it's nowhere near as stiff, the game ends up reminding me more of Ducktales due to the variety of moves available.  </p>
<h2><a href="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/sonic-usb-online.1771/">Sonic USB Online</a></h2>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/games/sage/usb.png"><br>
The Sonic CD design philosophy cranked up to the absolute maximum, how the hell does this have so much content packed in I'm never getting through all of this <em>WHY IS ECCO GETTING IN THE SPECIAL STAGE RING</em>  </p>
<p>I like the emphasis on badnik bounce combos to get extra XP, even though I'm not sure what the XP actually does...
Game is all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sv2g0eOzW0">vibes</a> though, I really dig the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk-yGZu_Yy4">soundtrack</a> and aesthetics overall.</p>
<p>(the online features are ok? I guess? it's mostly people trying to figure out how to unlock characters)</p>
<h2><a href="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/gunburst.1894/">Gunburst</a></h2>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/games/sage/gunburst.jpeg"><br>
Small 1-boss demo, played it on a real MegaDrive for kicks.<br>
Game looks great! I could <strong>not</strong> beat that boss.  </p>
<p>The bounce attacks are way too unpredictable for a game with 1-hit kills.. I hope this gets completed though!  </p>
<h2><a href="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/sonic-and-the-gunslinger.1629/">Sonic and the Gunslinger</a></h2>
<p><img alt="absolutely not a saturn game i swear" src="./images/games/sage/gunslinger.jpg"><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wzSw2iuk_8"><strong>2023 YEAR OF FANG THE SNIPER YEAAAAAAAAAAAH</strong>  </a></p>
<p>I haven't played <a href="https://www.srb2.org/">SRB2</a> in close to 20 years at this point and it's crazy to see the kind of stuff that can be built with it now...</p>
<p>I really like the attempt at making this feel like a storybook game with multiple characters, it worked really well imo.
Levels are fun<sup id="ref-3"><a href="#note-3">***</a></sup> to go through, and I appreciate the attempt at giving each sonic level its own small gimmick to keep things fresh.</p>
<h2><a href="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/bun-n-gun-23-demo.1734/">Bun 'N Gun</a></h2>
<p><img alt="bun" src="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/attachments/screenshots3-png.22754/"><br>
Large levels to speed in while scavenger hunting for objectives.<br>
It's incredibly fun to just zip around the physics-based playground knowing the grappling hook can always save you even if you dash straight into a pit.  </p>
<p>The objective-based gameplay? Not as good sadly, targets are too small and having to capture them is a bore -- I think making them a bit larger and just having the player shoot them would help a lot in keeping the pace going.  </p>
<h2><a href="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/project-32x.1785/">Project 32X</a></h2>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/games/sage/32x.jpg"><br>
An attempt at remaking <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Mars">Sonic Mars.</a><br>
I appreciate the attempt in trying to make it look like a 32x game with the reduced draw distance and all, instead of reproducing chris' <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/File%3ASxc_sonicdemo1.gif">mockup</a> <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/File%3ASxc_sonicdemo2.gif">movies</a> 1:1.<br>
Not much going on for the moment, but might be cool if it gets finished.  </p>
<h2><a href="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/swolemochao-1-2-gym-of-the-year-edition.1660">Swolemochao 1&amp;2</a></h2>

i have a mechanical keyboard and the constant clacking while playing this made my wife leave me<br>
9/10  </p>
<h2><a href="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/game-cycle.1649">Game Cycle</a></h2>
<p><img alt="I'm aware I'm being pedantic but wow the pixel scaling on this is super off" src="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/attachments/newscreen1-png.21757/"><br>
This has a fake operating system, so of course i'm checking it out! This is a selection of faux-shareware games to play.   </p>
<p>I really like the concept of playtesting/having different challenges for each game - It reminds me of the Game Center CX NDS games<sup id="ref-4"><a href="#note-4">#</a></sup> which had similar mini-challenges to keep you playing those faux-retro games.  </p>
<p><sup>Except the games here are not very engaging...</sup><br>
I feel like there should be at least a few standout titles, while I can totally understand throwing a few intentional simple games for that authentic <em>90s shareware CD compilation</em> experience, none of the three games in the demo really made me want to keep playing.  </p>
<h1></h1>
<p><sup id="note-1"><a href="#ref-1">*</a> And actually try Monster World, watch Dirty Pair, etc etc you get the gist</sup><br>
<sup id="note-2"><a href="#ref-2">**</a> The music theme got a bit boring hearing 3 variants of it in a row... I don't think this would be a problem in the final version where you'd play other levels before coming back to level 1</sup><br>
<sup id="note-3"><a href="#ref-3">***</a> except those water wheel jumps, incredibly painful even with the bubble shield :') </sup><br>
<sup id="note-4"><a href="#ref-4">#</a> Which are getting a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBbEI8Pzan0">rerelease compilation</a> on Switch with updated 3D graphics and <strong>new games</strong>??? I don't think this'll get an english release sadly </sup>  </p>
