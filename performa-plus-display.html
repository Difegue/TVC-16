This is an Apple Performa Plus Display. It's...a completely standard Shadow Mask CRT.  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">The Apple Performa Plus Display was a low-end Goldstar-built 14-inch monitor designed and fabricated for the Macintosh Performa series. Apple slightly modified this device to create the Apple Color Plus monitor, which was essentially the Performa Plus Display in a nicer case. The Apple Performa Plus Display also had a tilt &amp; swivel stand.</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>I liked the size though, so I grabbed it! Only issue is that its cable was cut off.<br>
<img alt="this is fucking barbaric but what do you expect out of a screen with no detachable cable" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/performa/performa2.jpg"></p>
<p>The tube seemed to work fine when powered on, although there's no real way to make sure without feeding it a proper video signal! What the hell, let's take it apart.<br>
<img alt="dude it's alright CRTs can't kill yo-*dies in flyback transformer*" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/performa/performa3.jpg">  </p>
<p>The inside circuit looked pretty much perfect -- No blown caps or anything weird that'd have made me give up on the spot.<br>
What I'm interested in is the internal video connector here, which is at the other end of the cut-off cable:  </p>
<p><img alt="wish I had a time machine to '94 to ask apple/goldstar engineers why the ground isn't in the connector" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/performa/performa4.jpg"><br>
Of course, there's no detailed information on the net about the pinout of an internal video connector for a one-off CRT monitor.<br>
The Service Manual certainly doesn't help either:<br>
<img alt="haha yeah fuck you apple" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/performa/performaservice.png"><br>
So, how am I going to remake the cable for this thing?  </p>
<h1>Technotes to the rescue</h1>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Technical Notes provide late breaking information about new Apple technologies and supplementary documentation discussing some of the more complex issues related to programming for the Mac OS.</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>I was surprised to see that old Mac hardware is actually quite well documented thanks to Apple's old <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/navigation/#">technotes</a>.<br>
I used a <a href="https://www.fenestrated.net/mac/mirrors/Apple%20Technotes%20(As%20of%202002)/">mirror from 2002</a> to shorten a bit the amount of articles I had to search/read through, but you can certainly pull all the info you need from the official site.  </p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.fenestrated.net/mac/mirrors/Apple%20Technotes%20(As%20of%202002)/hw/hw_08.html">Color Monitor Connections</a> article basically gave me all the info I needed.<br>
Since this is Apple, Macintosh screens don't use classic VGA but DA-15 connectors with a custom pinout:<br>
<img alt="Macintosh II Video Card and Macintosh IIci Built-in Video" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/performa/mac_video.gif"><br>
Looking at this pinout and the way the cables are laid out/colored in the internal video connector, you can theorize a mapping. Let's look back at what is in the CRT:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The red/blue/white wires are each paired with a matching ground(black) wire.</li>
<li>After that, there is only one brown wire and two black wires left.</li>
<li>The chassis (global) ground isn't even on the connector, making it rather obvious.  </li>
</ul>
<p>It's easy to guess that the pairs of red/blue/white match the color signals (<code>RED/RED.GND</code>, <code>BLU/BLU.GND</code>, etc.). <sup><sub>It's a bit weird that Green is represented by a white wire, I guess they didn't have green ? </sup></sub><br>
What about the brown wire, though?  </p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle is that Mac screens don't use Horizontal/Vertical Sync like VGA, instead preferring to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_video_sync">Composite Sync</a>.<br>
The DA-15 pinout above has pins for VGA-style <code>HSYNC/VSYNC</code>, but those are meant for those not-at-all common cases where you'd hook up a VGA screen to your Mac with an adapter.  </p>
<p>Therefore, there are only <strong>two</strong> wires to hook up for the Sync signal (<code>CSYNC</code> and <code>CSYNC.GND</code>), instead of the four for VGA.(<code>HSYNC/VSYNC</code> and their matching grounds)<br>
It seems then likely that the brown wire is the <code>CSYNC</code> signal!  </p>
<h3>But aren't you missing some pins from the DA-15 picture?</h3>
<p>I am! I didn't talk about <code>SENSE0/1/2</code> yet.<br>
Those pins are meant to be grounded in specific ways to tell the Mac what kind of screen we're plugging in. For example:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">The Macintosh LC requires that pin 4 (SENSE0) be connected to Ground to signal the connection of a 640 x 480 monitor. The Macintosh LC requires that pin 4 and 10 (SENSE0 and SENSE2) be connected to Ground to signal the connection of a 512 x 384 monitor (i.e., the Macintosh 12&quot; RGB Display). The Macintosh LC requires that pin 10 (SENSE2) be connected to Ground to signal the connection of a VGA monitor. Pin 7 (SENSE1) is grounded in the Macintosh LC.</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>The way those pins are interpreted depends on the Macintosh you're plugging the screen into, but the one we're interested in never seems to change much: <code>Grounding SENSE0 means the monitor is 640x480.</code><br>
That's the resolution of the Performa Plus, so I'll be leaving the other two pins alone.  </p>
<h1>Time to connect</h1>
<p>I grabbed a cheap DA-15 cable off AliExpress and made an atrocious Frankencable out of it:<br>
<img alt="end my life" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/performa/performa5.jpg">  </p>
<p>The connections mostly match what I wrote above, except some yellow/white cables magically appeared at the end that weren't in the video connector.<br>
I guessed those were probably only there for DA-15 compliance and led nowhere, so I left 'em unconnected.  </p>
<p>I hooked up the other end of the cable to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Difegue/status/1206696379483148289?s=20">freshly-salvaged</a> Macintosh IIvx, powered everything on expecting to get a horribly mangled image and:  </p>
<p><img alt="haha this is a disaste-wait what" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/performa/performa6.jpg"><br>
<sup><sub>Wow this actually works </sup></sub> I mean <strong>of course it works!</strong><br>
<img alt="based" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/performa/izutsumi.gif"></p>
<h1>Screen size and final observations</h1>
<p><img alt="Macintosh IIvx" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/performa/performa7.jpg"><br>
The image quality is surprisingly good for a makeshift cable here -- No parasites or blurry picture.<br>
Although I found it odd that the image doesn't fill the screen entirely.<br>
Since the IIvx is a pretty old Mac(running System 7), I thought its video card might not have the horsepower to handle 640x480.  </p>
<p>No worries! Time to upgrade a bit and try the cable out on a Power Mac G3:<br>
<img alt="Power Mac G3" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/performa/performa8.jpg"><br>
This is <strong>slightly</strong> better! But not by much.<br>
The resolution utility in Mac OS 9 does say the screen resolution is at 640x480, so there are a few possible reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CRT itself is configured to display the image like this  </li>
<li>The screen actually supports resolutions higher than 640x480 and I fucked up forcing the resolution through <code>SENSE0</code>  </li>
<li>Those white/yellow cables aren't there just for show pardner ðŸ¤ </li>
</ul>
<p>For option 1 the only way out is aligning the CRT manually.<br>
While I'm less afraid of being zapped by CRTs after working on the eMac, this is next level and messing with factory settings is probably a terrible idea.</p>
<p>Option 2 can be tested on the Power Mac G3 by overriding the resolution with <a href="https://www.madrau.com/SRXv3/html/SR2/indexSR2.html">SwitchRes2</a>, which I'll try later.<br>
And if it's option 3, I probably won't even bother since the cable is already <em>pretty goodâ„¢</em> as it stands.  </p>
<p><img alt="Can't believe I bothered that much just for a dumb Apple sticker" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/performa/performa9.jpg"><br>
I thank the gods of NASA in these festive times for the gift that is duct tape. Happy 2020!  </p>
