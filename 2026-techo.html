    <p>It's <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/2026/y26/">Hobonichi Techo preview season</a> again!<br>
Here's a list of designs from this year's lineup I find neat‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.  </p>
<p>I usually make those Techoposts at the end of the year when I <a href="./2025-techo.html">switch my planner</a>, but most of the time what I bought is long sold out by this point...  </p>
<p>So I thought this year I'd actually make the post <em>right before sales actually begin</em> - It also serves as my shopping list as a result instead of having to keep 20 tabs on my desktop! I'm a genius.  </p>
<p>I'm not rehosting any images this time around, so make sure you have third-party images allowed in your browser.</p>
<h1>An aside about the Techo phone app</h1>
<p>While last year was a pretty good time Yen-wise to buy a planner, this year feels noticeably worse, <strong>especially</strong> if you're in the US... I guess you could try using their <a href="https://techoapp.1101.com/en/">new phone app</a> instead?<br>
<img alt="Techo phone app screenshot, Global Release in December 2025" src="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/images/tx/topen/1755513296640_mag_y26_techoapp_sq_en.jpg"><br>
I don't know how I feel about this, it looks a bit more fun than existing offerings like Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/12/apple-launches-journal-app-a-new-app-for-reflecting-on-everyday-moments/">Journal</a> app, but the reason I personally buy those planners is to, yknow, <strong>avoid using a computer</strong>.  </p>
<p>You can't really paste or draw random crap with a phone app and it's one of the reasons I've never really been able to keep up with digital note-taking<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#note-1">*</a></sup>... I'll still give it a spin just out of curiosity and because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3xDw-gBoXM">Shogo Sakai</a> is doing the BGM.  </p>
<p>The assistants look cute, but it's unclear if they're actually AI/LLM shit or not?<br>
If it's just some basic image recognition with prewritten lines, that'd be a breath of fresh air at this point.  </p>
<p>Anyway, on with the recs!  </p>
<h1>Techo/Planner Covers</h1>
<h3><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc26_inoue/">Yuichi Inoue - Hana (Flower)</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Yuichi Inoue - Hana (Flower)" src="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/oc26_inoue/prod_02.webp"><br>
This one is pretty nice and I really dig the yellow accent as you might have realized by how this blog looks.<br>
It's similar to 2020's <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2020/pc/detail_cover/oc20_ochitsuke/">Ochitsuke cover</a>, but with a bit more flair. The lavender bookmarks are nice too!  </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc26_mothersaturn/">MOTHER - Mr. Saturn (It‚Äôs Great)</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Mr. Saturn lenticular cover" src="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/oc26_mothersaturn/prod_02.webp"><br>
There have been a lot of Mr.Saturn themed covers over the years and I somehow haven't bought one yet... But this one is really tempting with the lenticular effect. Forget great, it's <strong>cool</strong>!<br>
It is a bit more expensive than the other covers though; Not to the outrageous level of the <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc25_mothernbike/">leather one from last year</a>, but still a solid 10‚Ç¨ extra from the flower one, for example.   </p>
<p>Also note the <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/cc26_mothersaturn/">larger A5 variant</a> with even more lenticular Mr.Saturns!<br>
I always buy the A6 planners, since I don't really write enough (or draw) to fill those huge A5 ones...  </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc26_jito/">Junji Ito - Tomie - Knowing Smile</a></h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/oc26_jito/prod_02.webp"><br>
What's up with the material choices this year? I'm not complaining though.<br>
The iridescent/shiny material peeking through works really well with Junji's older artwork on this one, it's giving old mecha anime freezeframe vibes. <sub>Does that make sense? I wish I had an example screenshot on hand but I don't</sub>  </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc25_ishikawa/">Naoki Ishikawa - Denali in the Midnight Sun #1</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Denali in the Midnight Sun cyanotype cover" src="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/oc25_ishikawa/prod_02.webp"><br>
This one is technically from last year, but it's still available and was in my bucket list back then.<br>
I just think cyanotype is really neat! It's also cheaper than the other covers due to being an older design.  </p>
<p>The inside of the cover is a bit boring, but that doesn't really matter when you're actually using it.  </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_coco_tamagotchi/">Tamagotchi - Cover on Cover for A6 Size (Growth Chart!)</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Tamagotchi - Cover on Cover" src="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/tt_coco_tamagotchi/prod_01.webp"><br>
The Tamagotchi collab for this year is pretty cool, but I'm not a fan of the <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc26_tamagotchi/">cover design</a> they put out for it -- It's far too busy and heavy on the pixel art overall... This translucent cover-on-cover though? Pretty good!  </p>
<p>Those are nice alternatives to buying "full" covers, since you can pair them with one of the (comparatively cheap) <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc25_colorswcandle/">unicolor covers</a> and mix-and-match however you want.<br>
If you're more money-savvy than I am and don't buy a brand new cover every year, cover-on-covers are nice alternatives to still switch up the design of your Techo every year.  </p>
<p>I might do something stupid this year and pair this with the Denali cover... It'd be fun, OK? <em>Do you hate fun or something?</em>  </p>
<h1>Stationery</h1>
<h3><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_template_moomin/">Hobonichi Stencil - Moomin</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Moomin stencil" src="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/tt_template_moomin/prod_02.webp"><br>
hell yeah I love me some Moomin  </p>
<p>Similarly to Tamagotchi, I'm not a fan of the <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_cover/oc26_moomin/">cover design</a> for this collab, but I'm probably going to grab this stencil so I can mindlessly doodle some Finn creatures in my pages from time to time.  </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_addonfusen_tsuki/">Add-on Sticky Notes</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Add-on Sticky Notes" src="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/tt_addonfusen_tsuki/loc_02.webp"><br>
This is one of those "holy shit <em>technology</em>" type of stationery, similar to the <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_pocket/">Pocket Cards</a> which I'm a huge fan of.<br>
Usually when I write too much I just overflow a bit on the pages of the prior/next day, but being able to just paste an additional sheet like that...what power!  </p>
<p>Of course you could do this by just...pasting a bit of paper from wherever into your page and folding it, but it's nice to have a version that uses the exact same paper and grid size.  </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_cardset_tsuki/">TSUKI no IRO - Mini Card Set</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Mini Card Set w/ envelopes" src="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/tt_cardset_tsuki/loc_01.webp"><br>
Those are just some small cards and matching stickers, more for putting on top of presents than in a planner - I quite like the 70s-ness of the designs though, which is why it's here.</p>
<p>Like everything in the Tsuki no Iro series though, they're a bit expensive...<br>
Not as bad as "<em><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_uballset_tsuki/">64‚Ç¨ for 12 ballpoint pens</a> what do you MEAN</em>", but still.  </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_decorush_2026/">Deco Rush - Tamagotchi</a></h3>
<p><img alt="holy shit tama roll" src="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/tt_decorush_2026/prod_03.webp"><br>
Do I even have to say anything?<br>
...Well, I will say that <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_decorush/">Deco Rush</a> stickers are surprisingly more annoying to apply than you might think looking at the promo pictures -- You have to press down pretty hard or else they'll usually tear upon application.  </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_stappo_moomin/">Stappo - Moomin</a></h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/tt_stappo_moomin/prod_01.webp"><br>
I have now been shilling the Stappo stationery pouch for three years and will continue to do so as long as they release new banger designs for them.<br>
I almost wish I'd waited before getting mine now that they're putting out those nice versions with necktie fabric and embroidery... alas.<br>
<img alt="Stappo stationery pouch and pretzel-powered bag of holding" src="images/techo/stappo.jpg">  </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/s_maste/">Just some washi tape</a></h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/2026/detail_images/s_maste/prod_01.webp"><br>
Is this a boring one to end with? I dig the fruit/food sticker designs and they're about the price of a TF2 key each so...  </p>
<p>Also consider the <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2026/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_fusen_tamagotchi/">Tamagotchi sticky notes</a>.  </p>
