  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I opened a small user survey a few months ago to figure out what kind of features LANraragi users would want next.<br>
There's no "<em>telemetry but it's ok because you can turn it off and then everyone turns it off</em>" in the software, so it was interesting to figure out how many people use my ol' manager and what they get out of it.  </p>
<p>I planned to release the results alongside 0.6.0 but <a href="./doujinsoft-2.html">got sidetracked</a> and other stuff happened and uhhh we've been on beta 2 for like two months üôÉ  </p>
<p>So without further ado, the results! And my <strong>hot takes and opinions</strong> on some of the most frequent feature requests.  </p>
<h1>Total users and reasons to not install the software</h1>
<p><img alt="users" src="images/lrr-survey/users.png"><br>
I still thought I was being kinda niche, so it's super unexpected to see the number of concurrent users reach 70+.<br>
Github ‚≠ê count is at 130-something, which draws me ever closer to 4th place <a href="https://github.com/topics/mojolicious">in the mojolicious</a> list for e-bragging rights.  </p>
<p>Users that tried and didn't stick with LANraragi did so for the reasons I expected:<br>
<code>Ease of installation, and the fact it's not a desktop client.</code><br>
The survey was made before I introduced the <a href="./karen-1.html">new Windows installer</a>, which I hope alleviates the pain of installing the server for Windows users.  </p>
<p>As for the Desktop client, I could go the <a href="https://github.com/happypandax/desktop">HPX route</a> and cram my front-end in Electron or something, but I hardly see the capital gain from doing that.<br>
In my opinion, a Desktop app should have the matching UX (right-click context menus, higher information density), and add features that aren't possible within a browser's sandbox. (External reader support, for instance.)<br>
<sup>Also the current JavaScript code powering the front-end is a <em>mess</em> and I'd rather not twist it further to make it fit into a Desktop app üò∂ </sup>  </p>
<p>I toyed with building a proof-of-concept client on top of the current <a href="https://sugoi.gitbook.io/lanraragi/extending-lanraragi/client-api">API</a> using <a href="https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia">Avalonia</a>, but kinda stopped due to a lack of time. It's certainly possible, though.  </p>
<p>Among the "other" reasons people had, not being able to easily import metadata from the OG happypanda(not X) came up a few times.<br>
HP's original database is SQLite if I recall, it'd be possible to write a plugin that uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::SQLite">a Perl SQLite client</a> to pull the metadata from it on a file-to-file basis. Not trivial, however. HPX can consume the original HP's database as-is, so it's probably a better fit here.  </p>
<h1>Platforms</h1>
<p><img alt="platforms" src="images/lrr-survey/platforms.png"> <br>
Zero surprise here, the software is built with Linux+Docker in mind. There's been an uptick in Windows+WSL usage with the fall of the panda as well.  </p>
<p>The "other" platforms are fun stuff like QNAP QTS NASes, ASUSTOR, Ploxmox, etc.<br>
I'd like to apologize to Raspberry Pi users for not providing an ARM container image for the time being.<br>
Hopefully as <a href="https://engineering.docker.com/2019/04/multi-arch-images/">buildx</a> becomes a thing, an easy way to build ARM containers on Github Actions will surface.  </p>
<h1>Storage</h1>
<p><img alt="storage" src="images/lrr-survey/storage.png">   </p>
<p>I admittedly was expecting more NAS users as that's the primary use case for LRR in my opinion, but that is fine too.<br>
Thumbnail view is near-ubiquituous, so I'll probably make it the default view in a later release.  </p>
<h1>Feature Requests</h1>
<p><img alt="features" src="images/lrr-survey/features.png">  </p>
<p><em>oh boy here we go</em>   </p>
<p>Categories/Archive Sets is the clear winner here, which is great as I'll be able to ignore cries for image folders for a while longer. ‚úå<br>
<sup>It's a pain I really don't want to do it reeeeeee </sup><br>
This feature is pretty generic and allows people to shape their collection however they want (chapters of a tank, favorites, etc.)</p>
<p>Regex searching and Tag suggestions are both pretty high up here, and will probably be done when I revamp the current index to use server-side processing instead of loading a big clunky JSON cache. I got a request for adding search to the API too so it all fits!  </p>
<p>The "Other" category was full of suggestions as expected; I'll be listing the biggest ones below:</p>
<h3>üëâ Mobile Client</h3>
<p>That's easy, that one <a href="https://github.com/Utazukin/Ichaival">already exists.</a> <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=39cZap0XcH8">Next!</a>  </p>
<h3>üëâ Sorting archives by Date Added</h3>
<p>This is a feature in Ichaival that isn't actually in the main client.<br>
I plan to modify the current list view to allow customizing the headers based on tag namespaces. So for example, you could replace the "Artist" column by "date_added", and sort that way.</p>
<h3>üëâ Show reading progress and total page count</h3>
<p>This got a <strong>ton</strong> of requests! It'll probably show up alongside the New! icon. Not too hard to add.  </p>
<h3>üëâ Add a Favorites system</h3>
<p>For all the sadpanda expatriates out there. Categories will probably fit that need for most people.  </p>
<p><a href="https://sugoi.gitbook.io/lanraragi/advanced-usage/favorite-tags">Favorite tags</a> are already a thing and can probably replace Favorites if all you need is a one-click shortcut to your favorite artist or fetish. </p>
<h3>üëâ Add a Ratings system</h3>
<p>I always felt like rating systems were bloat, so I won't implement this explicitly.<br>
Nothing's stopping you from making a <code>rating:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</code> tag, though. It might even look pretty cool once I implement customizing the list view as explained above.  </p>
<h3>üëâ External viewer support</h3>
<p>This request comes up every now and then; Sadly I can't do anything about it without a Desktop client first.<br>
HPX offers this option, but it just opens up the viewer program on the server. I still keep to my mantra of LRR being designed for NAS and storage servers first, so I won't implement viewers that way.</p>
<h3>üëâ Downloaders</h3>
<p>This comes up very often as well! And I don't want to do it! (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª<br>
Trying to have one program do everything by itself gets you something like Hydrus, which is incredibly impressive but also boasts a complex codebase as a result. This makes maintenance exponentially difficult.  </p>
<p>Adding downloader support is a huge time investment, and would probably yield a result inferior to what dedicated downloader programs can currently do. I'd rather spend time making sure what's already in place is fast and functional.</p>
<h3>üëâ Support for PDF archives</h3>
<p>This is actually not that hard! If we're considering the PDFs only have images and no text of any kind.<br>
Maybe someday.</p>
<h3>üëâ Duplicate detection</h3>
<p>Currently, exact duplicate files are detected and marked as such. I don't plan to go further for the time being.</p>
<h3>üëâ Auto-tag support for esoteric filenames from esoteric programs</h3>
<p>I've had some requests for being able to get metadata from files named <code>[[EBA]_Dutch_Wife_Ooyasan__Landlady_Dutch_Wife_(Action_Pizazz_HB_2013-10)_[English]_TV]</code>, or archives downloaded using software like https://github.com/RicterZ/nhentai and https://github.com/seven332/EhViewer.</p>
<p>LRR tries to infer tags from archive filenames when they follow the E-H naming standard.<br>
Past that, support for other naming standards, or metadata embedded in archives falls under the plugin system.  </p>
<h3>üëâ HD Thumbnails</h3>
<p>This is coming from one of the only macOS users, with their fancy schmanzy retina screens. Makes sense.<br>
Currently thumbnails are indeed a bit too small for hi-res displays. I'm considering just doubling their resolution as-is.<br>
I don't think this will impact storage too much! Otherwise it'd probably have to be a togglable option.</p>
<h3>üëâ Rolling automatic backups</h3>
<p>I got an issue in about adding an API for making/restoring backups, so I'll probably do that instead so people can automate their own backup strategy.<br>
It does remind me I still haven't implemented log rotation, though.</p>
<h3>üëâ Easier way to update the WSL/Karen installation</h3>
<p>I initially planned to keep the bootloader/Karen installation static, and allow sideloading new LRR releases as they come(with an update button and everything). That was technically a bit harder so I gave up on it.  </p>
<p>PowerShell scripts for installing/uninstalling aren't convenient, and ideally I'd like to move to a proper Windows installer package further down the line.<br>
Making .msis is a pain in the ass though, so don't expect that soon. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>
<h3>üëâ Miscellaneous reader UX woes</h3>
<p>Everyone has their own favorite way to read, and as such it's really hard to make a one-size fits all reader.<br>
(Which is why desktop client + external reader would certainly alleviate that pain.)  </p>
<p>Here are most of the remarks I received. The <a href="https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/issues/114">UX improvements</a> issue also keeps growing with everyone adding in their own remarks, which makes this all rather hard to track.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic slideshow mode with configurable timer  </li>
<li>"Long strip" view from Mangadex  </li>
<li>Random next/previous page  </li>
<li>Easier way to copy the current image from the reader  </li>
<li>Display archive tags in reader  </li>
<li>Proper full-size image link for two-page mode  </li>
</ul>
<p>I'll tackle some of those every now and then, probably.<br>
The reader itself is in pretty good shape as far as JavaScript goes (unlike the archive index), so it's easy to work on.  </p>
<h3>üëâ Provide a better discussion place for support and plugin sharing</h3>
<p>This is interesting so I'm keeping it for last: It's true that discussion is a bit hard to track in the non-specific management threads.  </p>
<p>There are a number of options available, like 8chan, gitter, discord(ew), IRC... I'm not sure what would be best so if you have any ideas it'd be cool to drop a comment below.  </p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I went ahead and wanked out a Discord server you can find <a href="https://discord.gg/aRQxtbg">here.</a> Please enjoy!  </p>
