  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I recently found an old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMac">eMac</a>.  </p>
<p><img alt="yeah rip" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/emac/emac (1).jpg">  </p>
<p>It was not in good shape.<br>
I never really dabbled in Apple hardware before this (in fact my first real hands-on with Mac OS as a whole was what, 8 months ago ?), so I quickly tried booting it and it seemed to work! Except the CRT coil was glowing red. Neat.  </p>
<p>There's a surprising amount of documentation online about restoring eMacs -- Probably due to a mix of the failing analog boards and the low pricepoint of the machine. As a result, I tried fixing the thing. Here are a few notes.  </p>
<h2>Getting some reading done</h2>
<p>The essential reference for eMac modification is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180220163441/http://www.lbodnar.dsl.pipex.com/eServer/">Leo Bodnar's site</a>, or at least the archive.org snapshots of it, as it has since then died a brutal death.  </p>
<p>Other helpful links were <a href="https://fr.ifixit.com/Device/eMac">iFixit</a> for figuring out how to dismantle the beast, and the <a href="http://gmcotton.com/Ham_Radio/MISC%20Manuals/Mac/emac%20service%20manual.pdf">Original Apple service manual.</a> Basic stuff.  </p>
<p>My initial reference and guide for most of the process was this <a href="https://ierna.com/2006/07/02/emac-lcd-conversion/">2006 article</a> on an eMac LCD conversion. Quite detailed but it misses a few details, which I'll go over here.  </p>
<h2>Connecting the logic board to a working screen and power supply</h2>
<p>Once the machine taken apart, I've recovered the original power and video cables that were connected to the CRT board, and modified them to connect to Molex/VGA respectively.<br>
The pinouts can be found on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180220163441/http://www.lbodnar.dsl.pipex.com/eServer/">Leo Bodnar archive</a>, alongside a more detailed breakout of the different boards present in the machine.</p>
<p>As far as the power cable goes, it can really connect to anything that outputs both 12 and 5V -- As mentioned in the archive, the eMac actually expects 20 and 19V on a few of its pins for Firewire support, but using 12V for those works fine enough.  </p>
<p>I did redirect the hard drive and DVD player to run off the PSU directly instead of the eMac's integrated down-converter board, in order to make sure those have the voltage they need.  </p>
<p><img alt="damn that's a lot of icons" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/emac/emac (2).jpg">  </p>
<p>Well whaddaya know, this actually works. Time to drop all this good stuff into a case.  </p>
<h2>Dropping the LCD screen</h2>
<p>Any well-proportioned 17" LCD fits the eMac front panel, but if you're like me and blindly followed the ierna blog thinking you could just slam it in and call it a day, you'll probably be surprised.  </p>
<p><img alt="lcd dropped in emac front panel" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/emac/emac (3).jpg">  </p>
<p>My screen had bigger bezels than the one he used, which required me to cut off the microphone support stand and use tape to fix it instead.<br>
<img alt="microphone support(pic from ierna)" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/emac/micro.jpg"><br>
(pic from ierna, as I didn't take a picture of this part.)  </p>
<p>This made the screen fit fine in the panel, but the CRT cowl which comes on top of it was too small as well!<br>
The cowl is essential to the structure of the machine, but luckily you can get away with just cutting the corners.<br>
<img alt="damn that's a lot of icons" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/emac/emac (4).jpg">  </p>
<p>As a tradeoff though, I didn't cut the outside of the case like ierna, so all those modifications are invisible.<br>
Sure, I can't turn off the screen and the OSX Menu is slightly hidden by the front panel but ehh, I'll fix it in software.  </p>
<h2>Mounting the power supply</h2>
<p>Mounting a full-sized ATX PSU in the original case was challenging, and is frankly overkill considering the eMac doesn't draw that much power.<br>
Sadly it's all I had on hand so I rolled with it.  </p>
<p>There are mounting holes on the plate since it originally housed the analog board, but of course they don't line up whatsoever with ATX, so I had to make some custom mounting brackets to get it to stay fixed. I really hope you guys don't do this.  </p>
<p><img alt="screwing those bottom screws with the plastic parts blocking your paths was a real joy" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/emac/emac (5).jpg">  </p>
<p>One last hurdle caused by the ATX supply was that it was blocking the pins of the plastic case when putting the eMac back together.<br>
The pins go in the two large holes on top you can see there, so I had to sand them down a bit to make them smaller.  </p>
<p>And it's done! Well, almost.  </p>
<h2>Display refresh rate hell</h2>
<p><img alt="pictures taken moments before disaster" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/emac/emac (6).jpg">  </p>
<p>So, I got 10.14 Tiger booted up, listened to some music through iTunes and it seems fine!<br>
Then I went to toy a bit in the settings and everything fell apart.  </p>
<p>As mentioned by lbodnard, the eMac's screen resolutions use <strong>very high</strong> refresh rates (up to 100Hz), which go far beyond what old TFT LCDs can handle.<br>
OSX seemed to know about this at first and set a 75Hz rate so my LCD was usable, but a misstep on my part in System Settings set the resolution to an unusable rate.  </p>
<p>Therefore, my eMac is left without a screen again. 😐<br>
Resetting the resolution settings <a href="http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2001100114532165">seems rather easy</a> if you have filesystem access, but I don't, so I'll probably have to take the machine apart again and plug in a newer screen that can handle the high rates.  </p>
<p>If there's one warning to take from this, it's that you should probably enable Mac OS's built-in SSH/VNC servers so you can run the eMac headless -- Screen lockout happens easily!  </p>
<h2>Update: Getting out of display rate hell</h2>
<p>The solution to the above conundrum was indeed plugging in another screen. Luckily OSX wasn't stuck at some super high rate, so a more recent LCD did the trick.  </p>
<p><img alt="all's right with the world thanks to switchresx" src="https://tvc-16.science/images/emac/emac_end.jpg">  </p>
<p>I promptly installed an old version of <a href="http://www.madrau.com/index.html">SwitchResX</a> in order to disable all the extra resolutions the eMac adds to account for its normal CRT screen.<br>
This means no more surprises when starting a game that goes to fullscreen and tries to guess the best resolution out of what the machine offers.  </p>
<p>And I guess I'm finally done with this machine! It took quite a while.<br>
<sub><sup>The hard drive is starting to fail though so I'll probably need to clone it and drop a new IDE drive in this sucker...</sup></sub></p>
<h2>Final notes</h2>
<p>My first experience with OSX was with 10.14 Mojave a few months back -- Using 10.4 Tiger on this machine, it's pretty funny how 98% of the UI has essentially stayed the same in 13 years.<br>
Guess I'm too used to Windows switching everything around every couple of releases.  </p>
<p>At least I don't have to learn how to use the Finder again!  </p>
